<span class="s0">## Statement of Purpose</span>

<span class="s0">The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer</span>
<span class="s0">exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and</span>
<span class="s0">subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of</span>
<span class="s0">authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).</span>

<span class="s0">Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the</span>
<span class="s0">purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works</span>
<span class="s0">(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of</span>
<span class="s0">infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and</span>
<span class="s0">redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,</span>
<span class="s0">including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute</span>
<span class="s0">to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further</span>
<span class="s0">production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or</span>
<span class="s0">greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of</span>
<span class="s0">others.</span>

<span class="s0">For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of</span>
<span class="s0">additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a</span>
<span class="s0">Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright</span>
<span class="s0">and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and</span>
<span class="s0">publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her</span>
<span class="s0">Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal</span>
<span class="s0">effect of CC0 on those rights.</span>

<span class="s0">1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be</span>
   <span class="s0">protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and</span>
   <span class="s0">Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited</span>
   <span class="s0">to, the following:</span>
   <span class="s0">1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,</span>
      <span class="s0">and translate a Work;</span>
   <span class="s0">2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);</span>
   <span class="s0">3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness</span>
      <span class="s0">depicted in a Work;</span>
   <span class="s0">4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,</span>
      <span class="s0">subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;</span>
   <span class="s0">5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in</span>
      <span class="s0">a Work;</span>
   <span class="s0">6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the</span>
      <span class="s0">European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal</span>
      <span class="s0">protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,</span>
      <span class="s0">including any amended or successor version of such directive); and</span>
   <span class="s0">7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world</span>
      <span class="s0">based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations</span>
      <span class="s0">thereof.</span>

<span class="s0">2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,</span>
   <span class="s0">applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and</span>
   <span class="s0">unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright</span>
   <span class="s0">and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now</span>
   <span class="s0">known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of</span>
   <span class="s0">action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum</span>
   <span class="s0">duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time</span>
   <span class="s0">extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of</span>
   <span class="s0">copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation</span>
   <span class="s0">commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer</span>
   <span class="s0">makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and</span>
   <span class="s0">to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that</span>
   <span class="s0">such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,</span>
   <span class="s0">termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet</span>
   <span class="s0">enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express</span>
   <span class="s0">Statement of Purpose.</span>

<span class="s0">3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be</span>
   <span class="s0">judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver</span>
   <span class="s0">shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account</span>
   <span class="s0">Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the</span>
   <span class="s0">Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a</span>
   <span class="s0">royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,</span>
   <span class="s0">irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and</span>
   <span class="s0">Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the</span>
   <span class="s0">maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time</span>
   <span class="s0">extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of</span>
   <span class="s0">copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation</span>
   <span class="s0">commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License</span>
   <span class="s0">shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the</span>
   <span class="s0">Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally</span>
   <span class="s0">invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or</span>
   <span class="s0">ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in</span>
   <span class="s0">such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any</span>
   <span class="s0">of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)</span>
   <span class="s0">assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,</span>
   <span class="s0">in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.</span>

<span class="s0">4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</span>
   <span class="s0">1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,</span>
      <span class="s0">surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.</span>
   <span class="s0">2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties</span>
      <span class="s0">of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or</span>
      <span class="s0">otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,</span>
      <span class="s0">merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or</span>
      <span class="s0">the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or</span>
      <span class="s0">absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest</span>
      <span class="s0">extent permissible under applicable law.</span>
   <span class="s0">3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons</span>
      <span class="s0">that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without</span>
      <span class="s0">limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.</span>
      <span class="s0">Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary</span>
      <span class="s0">consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.</span>
   <span class="s0">4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a</span>
      <span class="s0">party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this</span>
      <span class="s0">CC0 or use of the Work.</span>
