<span class="s0">-----------------------------------------------------------</span>
<span class="s0">SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</span>
<span class="s0">-----------------------------------------------------------</span>

<span class="s0">PREAMBLE</span>
<span class="s0">The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide</span>
<span class="s0">development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation</span>
<span class="s0">efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and</span>
<span class="s0">open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership</span>
<span class="s0">with others.</span>

<span class="s0">The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and</span>
<span class="s0">redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The</span>
<span class="s0">fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, </span>
<span class="s0">redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved</span>
<span class="s0">names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,</span>
<span class="s0">however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The</span>
<span class="s0">requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply</span>
<span class="s0">to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</span>

<span class="s0">DEFINITIONS</span>
<span class="s0">&quot;Font Software&quot; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright</span>
<span class="s0">Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may</span>
<span class="s0">include source files, build scripts and documentation.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to any names specified as such after the</span>
<span class="s0">copyright statement(s).</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as</span>
<span class="s0">distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,</span>
<span class="s0">or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the</span>
<span class="s0">Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a</span>
<span class="s0">new environment.</span>

<span class="s0">&quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical</span>
<span class="s0">writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</span>

<span class="s0">PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS</span>
<span class="s0">Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining</span>
<span class="s0">a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,</span>
<span class="s0">redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font</span>
<span class="s0">Software, subject to the following conditions:</span>

<span class="s0">1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,</span>
<span class="s0">in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.</span>

<span class="s0">2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,</span>
<span class="s0">redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy</span>
<span class="s0">contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be</span>
<span class="s0">included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or</span>
<span class="s0">in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or</span>
<span class="s0">binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</span>

<span class="s0">3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font</span>
<span class="s0">Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding</span>
<span class="s0">Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as</span>
<span class="s0">presented to the users.</span>

<span class="s0">4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font</span>
<span class="s0">Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any</span>
<span class="s0">Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the</span>
<span class="s0">Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written</span>
<span class="s0">permission.</span>

<span class="s0">5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,</span>
<span class="s0">must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be</span>
<span class="s0">distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to</span>
<span class="s0">remain under this license does not apply to any document created</span>
<span class="s0">using the Font Software.</span>

<span class="s0">TERMINATION</span>
<span class="s0">This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are</span>
<span class="s0">not met.</span>
