<span class="s4">class </span><span class="s1">MessageListener(object):</span>

  <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Listens for modifications made to a message.  Meant to be registered via 
  Message._SetListener(). 
 
  Attributes: 
    dirty:  If True, then calling Modified() would be a no-op.  This can be 
            used to avoid these calls entirely in the common case. 
  &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

  <span class="s4">def </span><span class="s1">Modified(self):</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;Called every time the message is modified in such a way that the parent 
    message may need to be updated.  This currently means either: 
    (a) The message was modified for the first time, so the parent message 
        should henceforth mark the message as present. 
    (b) The message's cached byte size became dirty -- i.e. the message was 
        modified for the first time after a previous call to ByteSize(). 
        Therefore the parent should also mark its byte size as dirty. 
    Note that (a) implies (b), since new objects start out with a client cached 
    size (zero).  However, we document (a) explicitly because it is important. 
 
    Modified() will *only* be called in response to one of these two events -- 
    not every time the sub-message is modified. 
 
    Note that if the listener's |dirty| attribute is true, then calling 
    Modified at the moment would be a no-op, so it can be skipped.  Performance- 
    sensitive callers should check this attribute directly before calling since 
    it will be true most of the time.
